# Generating_Faces
Using celebrity image data to generate new faces using DCGANs

## What are DCGANs?? <br>
GANs or Generative Adversarial Networks are generative models that generate images one pixel at a time. To generate our fake images we will be using convolutional layers, which is why are model is called a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network or DCGAN. <br>

## Steps involved:- <br>
### 1- Loading and pre-processing Images <br>

### 2- Model Definition - Discriminator <br>

### 3- Model Definition - Generator <br> 

### 4- Weight Initialization <br>

### 5- Building the complete model <br> 

### 6- Define Loss Functions and Optimizers <br> 

### 7- Train <br> 

### 8- Display Samples <br>
