# Generating_Faces
Using celebrity image data to generate new faces using DCGANs

## What are DCGANs?? <br>
GANs or Generative Adversarial Networks are generative models that generate images one pixel at a time. To generate our fake images we will be using convolutional layers, which is why are model is called a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network or DCGAN. <br>
